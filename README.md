# Slate config

[Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is a window control utility for Mac OS X. This is my local Slate configuration.

## Rundown

### ctrl + option + cmd + right or left arrow keys
Moves a window over a screen and makes it full size.

I use this to send things like Spotify to my second monitor.

### ctrl + 4 & ctrl + 6
Full height window, half width, at the left(4) or right(6).

### ctrl + 7 & ctrl + 9
A short wide window at the top (7) and a short wide window at the bottom (9).

I use these mostly in the Finder, to open two windows for moving files between folders.
